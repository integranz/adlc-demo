# Pipeline rules (GitHub Actions)

- CI and CD are separate workflows. CI builds, tests, computes the version with Nerdbank.GitVersioning, pushes `acradlcdemo.azurecr.io/<app>:<semver>` and publishes a release manifest. CD (`workflow_dispatch` with `tag` and `environment` inputs) deploys exactly that tag.
- Cloud authentication is OIDC federated credentials (`azure/login` with `id-token: write`); no client secrets in repository secrets.
- CD applies `infra/app` behind the GitHub Environment approval; no other job runs `terraform apply`.
- `workflow_run` is not used to pass a tag between workflows (it cannot carry inputs); `/adlc:deploy` triggers CD explicitly.
- Every pushed tag is immutable and traceable to a commit (`sha-<short>` alias allowed alongside the semver).
- Registry pulls for hardened base images use a Docker Hub token from repository secrets (`docker login dhi.io`), never inline credentials.
